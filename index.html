    <center><h1>Hey, there! Name's Jayson!</h1></center>
  <center><p>I am an artist who gravitates towards characters more than anything. I first became an artist out of a desire to show others my ideas visually. And so, I have been drawing since the age of 10, trying to improve as much as possible. Currently, I focus on drawing digitally on my phone and I haven't touched traditional in a loooong time. I have started doing commissions for money but I do not plan to try and do art as a full time job. A better plan in my eyes is to keep it a hobby alongside a more steady job.</p></center>
