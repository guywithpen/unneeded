    <h1>Plagueofgripes</h1>
     <p>Out of all three, I have been following Plagueofgripes the longest. He makes interesting art videos like the ones based around "trifusion" in which he combines three characters in different ways to create new designs. He also discusses aspects of art and character design often in his videos.</p>

    <h1>Crabby-draws</h1>
    <p>Crabby-draws is another artist on youtube I fine interesting and only found out about recently. His videos also discuss character design and while his uploads are few, the content so far suggests awesome uploads to come.</p>
